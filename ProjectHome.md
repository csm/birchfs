**NOTE**: Birch was interesting to write, but Google's gone and made it obsolete. See http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/, and SpotlightFS.app. So, I am considering this project as dead now.

Birch is a metadata search file system for Mac OS X. It represents Spotlight metadata queries as directories, and the files within directories are matches to that query.

This project is being done as a part of UCSC course CMPS 221: Advanced Operating Systems.
